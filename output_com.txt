This process violates the following regulations along with their corresponding reasons:
##Regulation: If the pharmacy does not perform prescription verification, it is a violation process.
##Reason for Violation: Violation. The process includes a step for the pharmacy to 'Check the prescription', which implies that prescription verification is performed. However, the process also includes a branch where the pharmacy does not perform prescription verification if the prescription contains no prescription drugs. Therefore, if prescription drugs are involved, the pharmacy must verify the prescription; otherwise, it would be a violation of the regulation. The process description does not clearly indicate that prescription verification is always performed when prescription drugs are involved, which is required by the regulation.

.\LPD4VR-master\compliance\ConsultationWithPicture.bpmn
This process violates the following regulations along with their corresponding reasons:
##Regulation: During disease diagnosis, if medical staff do not perform identity authentication before online diagnosis and treatment, it will be judged as a violation of the process.
##Reason for Violation: Violation. The process includes an activity 'Start the consultation' by medical staff, but there is no prior identity authentication by the medical staff themselves before online diagnosis and treatment. The identity authentication is performed by the 'Internet healthcare service platform provider' in the activity 'Authentication', which does not fulfill the requirement for medical staff to perform this authentication.
--------------------
.\LPD4VR-master\compliance\ConsultationWithVideo.bpmn
This process violates the following regulations along with their corresponding reasons:
##Regulation: During disease diagnosis, if medical staff do not perform identity authentication before online diagnosis and treatment, it will be judged as a violation of the process.
##Reason for Violation: Violation. The process does not include any activity where the medical staff perform identity authentication before the online diagnosis and treatment, which violates the regulation that requires identity authentication during disease diagnosis.
--------------------
.\LPD4VR-master\compliance\ConsultationwithvideoService.bpmn
This process violates the following regulations along with their corresponding reasons:
##Regulation: During disease diagnosis, if the Internet healthcare service provider does not judge whether the user is the first diagnosis online, it will be judged as a violation of the process.
##Reason for Violation: Violation. The process does not include any activity where the Internet healthcare service platform provider judges whether the user is undergoing their first diagnosis online. This omission violates the regulation that requires such a judgment during disease diagnosis.
##Regulation: During disease diagnosis, if medical staff do not perform identity authentication before online diagnosis and treatment, it will be judged as a violation of the process.
##Reason for Violation: Violation. The process indicates that the activity 'Authenticate' is executed after the activity 'Confirmation of completed payment' and before the activity 'Online diagnosis'. This means the medical staff do perform identity authentication before online diagnosis and treatment, complying with the regulation. However, the regulation requires identity authentication by medical staff specifically before the online diagnosis, and the process does not explicitly mention that the medical staff are the ones performing the authentication. Therefore, it is judged as a violation of the process.
##Regulation: During appointment for medical treatment, if the platform does not judge whether the user's online diagnosis and treatment appointment is the first diagnosis and treatment, then it is judged as a violation process.
##Reason for Violation: Violation. The process does not include an activity where the platform judges whether the user's online diagnosis and treatment appointment is the first diagnosis and treatment. This omission constitutes a violation of the regulation.
