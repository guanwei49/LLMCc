.\LPD4VR-master\compliance\ConsultationWithPicture.bpmn
This process violates the following regulations along with their corresponding reasons:
##Regulation: During online disease diagnosis, if the Internet healthcare service provider does not judge whether the user is the first diagnosis online, it will be judged as a violation of the process.
##Reason for Violation: Violation. The process includes an activity 'Test for first visit', which determines whether it is the user's first time. However, this activity is not performed by the 'Internet healthcare service platform provider', but rather as part of the process flow. The regulation specifically requires that the 'Internet healthcare service provider' must judge whether the user is the first diagnosis online, which is not evident in the provided process details.
##Regulation: During online disease diagnosis, if medical staff do not perform identity authentication before online diagnosis and treatment, it will be judged as a violation of the process.
##Reason for Violation: Violation. The process involves online disease diagnosis, and the regulation requires that medical staff perform identity authentication before online diagnosis and treatment. However, in the provided process, the activity 'Authentication' is performed by the 'Internet healthcare service platform provider' and not by the 'medical staff'. Therefore, this process violates the regulation.

.\LPD4VR-master\compliance\ConsultationWithVideo.bpmn
This process violates the following regulations along with their corresponding reasons:
##Regulation: During online disease diagnosis, if the Internet healthcare service provider does not judge whether the user is the first diagnosis online, it will be judged as a violation of the process.
##Reason for Violation: Violation. The process includes an activity 'Is it the first time', which is responsible for determining whether it is the user's first diagnosis online. However, this activity is not performed by the 'Internet healthcare service platform provider', but rather seems to be part of the decision-making process without a specified responsible participant. Thus, the Internet healthcare service provider is not explicitly judging whether the user is having their first diagnosis online, which violates the regulation.

.\LPD4VR-master\compliance\OnlineConsultationProcess.bpmn
This process violates the following regulations along with their corresponding reasons:
##Regulation: During online disease diagnosis, if the Internet healthcare service provider does not judge whether the user is the first diagnosis online, it will be judged as a violation of the process.
##Reason for Violation: Violation. The process includes an activity 'Is it the first time', which is a decision point to determine whether it is the user's first diagnosis online. However, this activity is handled by the 'Internet healthcare service platform provider', which complies with the regulation. Therefore, the process complies with the regulation.
##Regulation: During online disease diagnosis, if medical staff do not perform identity authentication before online diagnosis and treatment, it will be judged as a violation of the process.
##Reason for Violation: Violation. The process violates the regulation because the medical staff is responsible for the activity 'Perform real-name authentication', which is the identity authentication step, but this step occurs after the 'Consultation Reminder' and before the 'The consultation begins'. The regulation requires that identity authentication be performed before the online diagnosis and treatment, and in this process, it is not clear if the authentication is done before any diagnosis and treatment activities.
