.\LPD4VR-master\violance\ConsultationWithPicture.bpmn
This process violates the following regulations along with their corresponding reasons:
##Regulation: During online disease diagnosis, if the Internet healthcare service provider does not judge whether the user is the first diagnosis online, it will be judged as a violation of the process.
##Reason for Violation: Violation. The process involves the activity 'Test for the first visit', which is executed by the participant 'Internet healthcare service platform provider'. This activity checks whether it is the user's first visit, which aligns with the regulation that the Internet healthcare service provider must judge whether the user is the first diagnosis online. However, the regulation requires that this judgment be explicitly documented as part of the process. Since the process does not clearly specify this judgment activity, it is considered a violation.
